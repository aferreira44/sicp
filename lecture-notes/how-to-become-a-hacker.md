## Learn how to program

- Lisp / **Scheme**
- **C** / C++ / Rust
- **Python** / Go / JavaScript / Java
- **Haskell**, Clojure / Elixir

## So You Want to be a Programmer

1. Get interested in programming, and do some because it is fun.
2. Program. The best kind of learning is learning by doing.
3. Talk with other programmers; read other programs.
4. If you want, put in four years at a college (or more at a graduate school).
5. Work on projects with other programmers.
6. Work on projects after other programmers.
7. Learn at least a half dozen programming languages.
   1. Class abstractions (Java or C++)
   2. Functional abstraction (Lisp, ML, Haskell)
   3. Syntactic abstraction (Lisp)
   4. Declarative specifications (Prolog, C++ templates)
   5. Parallelism (Clojure, Go)
8. Know how long it takes your computer to execute an instruction, fetch a word from memory (with and without a cache miss), read consecutive words from disk, and seek to a new location on disk.
9. Get involved in a language standardization effort.

## Quotes

- _Learn how to think about programming problems in a general way, independent of any one language._
- _To be a real hacker, you need to get to the point where you can learn a new language in days by relating what's in the manual to what you already know._
